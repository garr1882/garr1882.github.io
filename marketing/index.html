      "I have been shopping at American Eagle for several years and it never fails to disappoint. American Eagle's clothes are trendy, stylish, and comfortable. American Eagle is also the only store where I can find jeans that fit me well, and better yet, their jeans are of great quality. I would recommend American Eagle to anyone."

      "I take my daughter to American Eagle for our 'girl day' outings. Not only does she always find the perfect fit with the latest styles, but I always find plenty of cute clothes for myself as well. The staff is always helpful and keeps us informed of the latest deals. We always have a great experience at American Eagle."

      "American Eagle stands out from its competitors with their quality. Because of prices, I usually wait for sales. But anything that I have bought after a sale has been of the utmost quality. It has made it so that sometimes, even if there isn't a sale going on, and I need something, I will go to them in order to find what I need. They are one of the first stores I go to, especially for jeans. Because of their quality, I am a customer."
